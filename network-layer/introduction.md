# Network Layer

Problems to be solved by the network layer:

- How do we address nodes' scalability across different networks?
- Given a destination address, how do we forward it scalably?
- How do the different networks coordinate so that each can reach destinations beyond their boundaries?
- How are addresses assigned and mapped to the link layer address?
- What tools can an admin use to troubleshoot beyond its network boundaries?
