# Mapping IP Addresses

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) helps facilitate global coordination and regional registries manage local IP address allocation. Internet service providers own large blocks and provide them to their customers.

## Mapping IP to MAC

ARP: Address resolution protocol - broadcasts "question" of IP address to see if it matches a MAC address in the network. Only the correct one will respond.

## Assigning an IP on a LAN

- Static assignment
- Dynamic assignment: dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) with a DHCP server (typically gateway router). Built into the operating system and happens automatically
