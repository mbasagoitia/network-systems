# Link Layer

Networks consist of links interconnecting nodes (through wires or wirelessly).

The link layer is implemented in hardware on a network interface card (NIC), enabling communication.

## Problems Solved by the Link Layer

- How we encode data such that each side can understand who it's destined for and how to interpret the data
- How we detect if an error has occurred and how to correct it
- For shared access mediums, how we coordinate between nodes to regulate access to the medium
- How to extend into a local area network (LAN) to extend beyond the physical limits of the transmission medium
