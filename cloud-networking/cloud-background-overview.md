# Cloud Background Overview

What is cloud computing? 

1. Elimination of an upfront commitment

Previously, when launching a service, you needed space, power, a network, equipment (servers, routers, firewalls), and configuration of the equipment.

2. Pay for use on a short-term basis

With fixed capacity, result will be under or over provisioning. Elasticity allows for provisioning what is needed in the moment.

3. Illusion of infinite computing resources

Predicting the future is hard. Will the service grow rapidly or slowly? Don't want to hurt growth if we didn't plan for growth.

**Why it Works**

Hyper scale: Costs of electricity, networks, etc. (economies of scale). Very large data centers (Amazon, Google, etc.) with lots of resources can pass savings to its users.

Expertise: Good at running infrastructure services like compute, storage, and databases, highly skilled at running reliable, scalable, and cost-effective data centers.

Infrastructure as a service: Delivers on-demand infrastructure resources to organization via the cloud. Customers don't have to maintain, manage, or update their own data center infrastructure, but are responsible for the operating system, middleware, virtual mahcines, and any apps or data.

Platform as a service: Delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. Developers and IT teams can use PaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on their own. Available from any of the cloud providers and from third parties, creating a rich ecosystem.

Software as a service: Provids the entire application stack. Delivers an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. Available from the cloud providers and third parties.
