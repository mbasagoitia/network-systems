# Inter-Cloud Connections

A company may want to use multiple cloud providers (Google, Azure, AWS)

Could use a VPN, but has low bandwith and high latency

## Cross Cloud Interconnect

Effectively a direct connect to each cloud plus a virtual router

Provider (partner or Google) runs/operates the virtual router

Can also work between different regions (over the fabric)

In GCP:

Interconnect -> Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection

Could also use partner network and configure connection to other cloud provider
